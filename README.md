# openMP_sparse_matrix_vector_multiplication
C++ and OpenMP implementation of Sparse Matrix And Vector Multiplication.

Code aims to test the scaling performance of OpenMP with the change in number of Cores and Threads.
Effect of Cache hits on the performance can be evaluated based on this, to check infrastructure scalability in CPU Parallel Loads.
